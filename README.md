# fore

Spec-driven development skills for coding agents. Forethought first, then move fore.

fore is a fork of [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) (MIT License). It keeps the same small, composable skills and rebrands the bundle as its own plugin, shipped through the `wxitzxg` marketplace.

Developing real applications is hard. Approaches like GSD, BMAD, and Spec-Kit try to help by owning the process. But while doing so, they take away your control and make bugs in the process hard to resolve.

These skills are designed to be small, easy to adapt, and composable. They work with any model. Hack around with them. Make them your own.

## Installation (30-second setup)

Two ways in, two philosophies. The **Claude Code plugin** installs the whole set as a managed, read-only bundle that updates when the marketplace updates, so you subscribe rather than fork. **skills.sh** copies editable skill files into your project, so you can hack on them and make them your own. Pick one: installing both leaves you with every skill twice.

### 1. Get the skills

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong></summary>

Add the marketplace once:

```
/plugin marketplace add wxitzxg/fore
```

Then install the plugin:

```
/plugin install fore@wxitzxg
```

Or from the shell:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add wxitzxg/fore
claude plugin install fore@wxitzxg
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Codex, and other agents</strong></summary>

```bash
npx skills@latest add wxitzxg/fore
```

Pick the skills you want, and which coding agents to install them on. **The installer lets you choose which skills to take, so make sure `setup` is one of them.**

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>For tinkerers</strong></summary>

Use the same installer, on any agent, including Claude Code:

```bash
npx skills@latest add wxitzxg/fore
```

It writes the skills into your repo as ordinary files you own and can edit. Nothing updates behind your back; pull the latest changes when you want them with `npx skills update`.

</details>

### 2. Run `/setup`

In your agent, run it once per repo. It will:

- Ask you which issue tracker you want to use (GitHub, GitLab, or local files)
- Ask you what labels you apply to tickets when you triage them (`/triage` uses labels)
- Ask you where you want to save any docs we create

### 3. You are ready to go.

## Why These Skills Exist

They target common failure modes when building software with coding agents.

### #1: The Agent Didn't Do What I Want

> "No-one knows exactly what they want"
>
> David Thomas & Andrew Hunt, [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pragmatic-Programmer-Anniversary-Journey-Mastery/dp/B0833F1T3V)

**The Problem**. The most common failure mode in software development is misalignment. You think the dev knows what you want. Then you see what they built, and you realize it did not understand you at all.

This is just the same in the AI age. There is a communication gap between you and the agent. The fix for this is a **grilling session**: getting the agent to ask you detailed questions about what you are building.

**The Fix** is to use:

- [`/grill-me`](./skills/productivity/grill-me/SKILL.md): for non-code uses
- [`/grill-with-docs`](./skills/engineering/grill-with-docs/SKILL.md): same as [`/grill-me`](./skills/productivity/grill-me/SKILL.md), but adds more goodies (see below)

They help you align with the agent before you get started, and think deeply about the change you are making. Use them every time you want to make a change.

### #2: The Agent Is Way Too Verbose

> With a ubiquitous language, conversations among developers and expressions of the code are all derived from the same domain model.
>
> Eric Evans, [Domain-Driven-Design](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321125215)

**The Problem**: At the start of a project, devs and the people they are building the software for (the domain experts) are usually speaking different languages.

The same tension appears with agents. Agents are usually dropped into a project and asked to figure out the jargon as they go. So they use 20 words where 1 will do.

**The Fix** for this is a shared language. It is a document that helps agents decode the jargon used in the project.

<details>
<summary>
Example
</summary>

Here is an example [`CONTEXT.md`](https://github.com/mattpocock/course-video-manager/blob/076a5a7a182db0fe1e62971dd7a68bcadf010f1c/CONTEXT.md), from the upstream author's `course-video-manager` repo. Which one is easier to read?

- **BEFORE**: "There's a problem when a lesson inside a section of a course is made 'real' (i.e. given a spot in the file system)"
- **AFTER**: "There's a problem with the materialization cascade"

This concision pays off session after session.

</details>

This is built into [`/grill-with-docs`](./skills/engineering/grill-with-docs/SKILL.md). It is a grilling session, but it also helps you build a shared language with the AI, and document hard-to-explain decisions in ADRs.

> [!TIP]
> A shared language has many other benefits than reducing verbosity:
>
> - **Variables, functions and files are named consistently**, using the shared language
> - As a result, the **codebase is easier to navigate** for the agent
> - The agent also **spends fewer tokens on thinking**, because it has access to a more concise language

### #3: The Code Doesn't Work

> "Always take small, deliberate steps. The rate of feedback is your speed limit. Never take on a task that is too big."
>
> David Thomas & Andrew Hunt, [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pragmatic-Programmer-Anniversary-Journey-Mastery/dp/B0833F1T3V)

**The Problem**: You and the agent are aligned on what to build, but the code it produces still does not work.

Without feedback on how the code it produces actually runs, the agent is flying blind.

**The Fix**: You need the usual tranche of feedback loops: static types, browser access, and automated tests.

For automated tests, a red-green-refactor loop is critical. The agent writes a failing test first, then makes it pass. This gives a consistent level of feedback that results in far better code.

The **[`/tdd`](./skills/engineering/tdd/SKILL.md)** skill slots into any project. It encourages red-green-refactor and gives the agent plenty of guidance on what makes good and bad tests.

For debugging, **[`/diagnosing-bugs`](./skills/engineering/diagnosing-bugs/SKILL.md)** wraps best debugging practices into a disciplined loop, gated phase by phase.

### #4: We Built A Ball Of Mud

> "Invest in the design of the system every day."
>
> Kent Beck, [Extreme Programming Explained](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321278658)

> "The best modules are deep. They allow a lot of functionality to be accessed through a simple interface."
>
> John Ousterhout, [A Philosophy Of Software Design](https://www.amazon.com/dp/173210221X)

**The Problem**: Most apps built with agents are complex and hard to change. Because agents can radically speed up coding, they also accelerate software entropy. Codebases get more complex at an unprecedented rate.

**The Fix** is caring about the design of the code.

This is built in to every layer of these skills:

- [`/to-spec`](./skills/engineering/to-spec/SKILL.md) quizzes you about which modules you are touching before creating a spec

And crucially, [`/improve-codebase-architecture`](./skills/engineering/improve-codebase-architecture/SKILL.md) surveys a codebase for deepening opportunities and hands you the candidates. It is a survey, not a rescue: on a genuinely old codebase it will find real candidates, but it will not untangle the mud for you.

### Summary

Software engineering fundamentals matter more than ever. These skills condense those fundamentals into repeatable practices for spec-driven development with an agent.

## Reference

These split on one axis: who can invoke them. **User-invoked** skills are reachable only when you type them (e.g. `/grill-me`); their job is to orchestrate. **Model-invoked** skills can be invoked by you or reached for automatically by the agent when the task fits; they hold the reusable discipline. A user-invoked skill may invoke model-invoked skills, but never another user-invoked one.

### Engineering

Skills for code work.

**User-invoked**

- **[guide](./skills/engineering/guide/SKILL.md)**: Ask which skill or flow fits your situation. A router over the user-invoked skills in this repo.
- **[grill-with-docs](./skills/engineering/grill-with-docs/SKILL.md)**: Grilling session that also builds your project's domain model, sharpening terminology and updating `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs inline.
- **[triage](./skills/engineering/triage/SKILL.md)**: Move issues through a state machine of triage roles.
- **[improve-codebase-architecture](./skills/engineering/improve-codebase-architecture/SKILL.md)**: Scan a codebase for deepening opportunities, present them as a visual HTML report, then grill through whichever one you pick.
- **[setup](./skills/engineering/setup/SKILL.md)**: Configure this repo for the engineering skills (issue tracker, triage labels, domain doc layout). Run once per repo before using the other engineering skills.
- **[to-spec](./skills/engineering/to-spec/SKILL.md)**: Turn the current conversation into a spec and publish it to the issue tracker. No interview, just synthesizes what you have already discussed.
- **[to-tickets](./skills/engineering/to-tickets/SKILL.md)**: Break any plan, spec, or conversation into a set of tracer-bullet tickets, each declaring its blocking edges, written as text in a local file, or as native blocking links on a real tracker.
- **[implement](./skills/engineering/implement/SKILL.md)**: Build the work described by a spec or set of tickets, driving `/tdd` at pre-agreed seams and closing out with `/code-review` before committing.
- **[submit](./skills/engineering/submit/SKILL.md)**: Push the current branch and open a pull request or merge request whose body closes the linked issues. Run by hand after implement, in the same session.
- **[wayfinder](./skills/engineering/wayfinder/SKILL.md)**: Plan a huge chunk of work, more than one agent session can hold, as a shared map of decision tickets on the issue tracker, and resolve them one at a time until the way to the destination is clear.

**Model-invoked**

- **[prototype](./skills/engineering/prototype/SKILL.md)**: Build a throwaway prototype to answer a design question, either a single shareable HTML file for state/logic questions, or several radically different UI variations toggleable from one route.
- **[diagnosing-bugs](./skills/engineering/diagnosing-bugs/SKILL.md)**: Disciplined diagnosis loop for hard bugs and performance regressions: build a feedback loop that goes red on this bug, then minimise, hypothesise, instrument, fix, and regression-test.
- **[research](./skills/engineering/research/SKILL.md)**: Investigate a question against high-trust primary sources and capture the findings as a cited Markdown file in the repo, run as a background agent.
- **[tdd](./skills/engineering/tdd/SKILL.md)**: Test-driven development with a red-green-refactor loop. Builds features or fixes bugs one vertical slice at a time.
- **[domain-modeling](./skills/engineering/domain-modeling/SKILL.md)**: Actively build and sharpen a project's domain model: challenge terms against the glossary, stress-test with edge-case scenarios, and update `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs inline.
- **[codebase-design](./skills/engineering/codebase-design/SKILL.md)**: Shared discipline and vocabulary for designing deep modules: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface, placed at a clean seam, testable through that interface.
- **[code-review](./skills/engineering/code-review/SKILL.md)**: Two-axis review of the diff since a fixed point: **Standards** (does it follow the repo's coding standards, plus a Fowler smell baseline?) and **Spec** (does it faithfully implement the originating issue/spec?), run as parallel sub-agents so neither pollutes the other.
- **[resolving-merge-conflicts](./skills/engineering/resolving-merge-conflicts/SKILL.md)**: Work through an in-progress git merge or rebase conflict hunk by hunk, resolving by intent traced to each side's primary source, then finish the operation (never `--abort`).
- **[wizard](./skills/engineering/wizard/SKILL.md)**: Generate an interactive bash wizard that walks a human through steps only they can perform: provisioning infrastructure, setting up credentials or CI secrets, walking an unfamiliar third-party dashboard, or running a one-off migration or cutover.
- **[pr](./skills/engineering/pr/SKILL.md)**: Write a structured pull request body: summary from the primary source, the smallest visual that shows the change, before/after evidence, and a one-way/two-way door call.

### Productivity

General workflow tools, not code-specific.

**User-invoked**

- **[grill-me](./skills/productivity/grill-me/SKILL.md)**: Get relentlessly interviewed about a plan or design until every branch of the design tree is resolved.
- **[handoff](./skills/productivity/handoff/SKILL.md)**: Compact the current conversation into a handoff document so another agent can continue the work.
- **[teach](./skills/productivity/teach/SKILL.md)**: Teach the user a new skill or concept over multiple sessions, using the current directory as a stateful teaching workspace.
- **[to-questionnaire](./skills/productivity/to-questionnaire/SKILL.md)**: Turn a decision you cannot answer alone into a Markdown questionnaire for the one person who can, filled in async, or together over a meeting. It grills you about the send (who it is for, what you need back), not the subject.
- **[wait-what](./skills/productivity/wait-what/SKILL.md)**: Fire this the moment a message does not land. The agent re-pitches it with the context you are missing, in plain English, using your `CONTEXT.md` vocabulary.

**Model-invoked**

- **[grilling](./skills/productivity/grilling/SKILL.md)**: Interview the user relentlessly about a plan, decision, or idea until every branch of the design tree is resolved. The reusable interview primitive behind `grill-me`, `grill-with-docs`, `triage`, `wayfinder` and `improve-codebase-architecture`.
- **[writing-for-agents](./skills/productivity/writing-for-agents/SKILL.md)**: Writing documents for agents: skills, AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, and any doc an agent reaches by a pointer.
