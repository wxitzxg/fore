# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root
- **`.agents/adr/`**: this repo's ADR directory. Read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

This repo is single-context: there is no `CONTEXT-MAP.md` and no per-context ADR tree. If a `docs/adr/` directory appears later, treat it the same way.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

This repo's actual layout:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── .agents/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-explicit-setup-pointer-only-for-hard-dependencies.md
│       ├── 0002-ship-as-a-claude-code-plugin.md
│       └── 0003-fork-as-fore.md
└── skills/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_
